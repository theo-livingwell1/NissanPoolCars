========================================================

Nissan pool cars are a range of different makes and models of cars. some of the models are
Toyota Corolla; Lotus Europa; Honda Civic; volvo 142E

The various makes and models vary in fuel consumption on miles per gallon, MPG.

A shiny application is created to help Nissan employees select a comfortable 
experience for their journeys when using pool cars. A comfortable experience means 
good performance on fuel usage within budget, speed and ease of tiredness 
depending on the type of transmission (Automatic or Manual) preferred.

How the app works

The app allows you, the user to inputs basic information about your journey. The app displays 
cars that are relevant to the user input allowing for peace of mind, relaxation and comfort 
during your journey.

The user provides two sets of information on the side panel: 

a. information about journey:  
1.	estimated distance
2.	Price of gasoline at the time of journey
3.	How much they are willing to spending on gasoline on entire journey

b. set pool car parameters such as horsepower, transmission type, how many gears etc


The main panel displays relevant matches for a comfortable journey after the user makes their input.
The user then have an idea of what to expect with the selected pool car before they start their journey.

Meeting these expectation is deemed comfortable drive.
